# CONTRIBUTING

All commands have some sort of documentation, at least they *should*.

We need help with the Wiki, if you want to help with that that would be awesome.

Other than general code optimization, (im new to java), the bot works, but any new features or ideas are welcome.

If you decide to contribute, fork this repo, make your changes and do a pull request, I'll look over the changes, and get back to you with feedback.

Thanks so much!

## GETTING THE BOT RUNNING

The bot uses environment variables to communicate with MySQL, DiscordAPI, and the GoogleAPI.

All of these things are *private* so I cannot give them to you, but as long as you have the environment vairables as follows all should be good.

```
token: <discord token>
gapi: <google api token>
sql_uname: <sql username>
sql_password: <sql password>
```

If you have issues getting this setup reach out to me and I'll help you out.
