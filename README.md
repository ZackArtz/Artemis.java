# Artemis.java

This is a discord bot written in JDA, with JDAUtils. To get started, make sure you have Java 11 and Gradle installed.

To build the jar, run `gradle shadowJar`.

If you would like to use docker, a Dockerfile is provided. For production, I use Kubernetes in turn with Docker, and you can 
see that process on the Actions tab.

To build with docker, make sure you have docker installed, then run `docker build -f Dockerfile` in the root directory.

For contributions, please go to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

For any questions, send me a message on discord here: `zxck#1337`.

Or you can email me here: zackmyers@lavabit.com
